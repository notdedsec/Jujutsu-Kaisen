Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.30,0:06:28.27,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,A scar on the face is a badge of honor for a man.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.32,0:06:32.16,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Though it's only a flaw on a woman.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.16,0:06:33.40,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.79,0:06:36.99,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,You think being a jujutsu sorcerer is all about strength, don't you?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.04,0:06:47.14,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Even if they are strong, women have to be cute, or they'll be undervalued.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.14,0:06:51.64,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Of course, even if they're cute, they'll still be undervalued if they're not also strong.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.08,0:06:53.39,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Do you get it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.76,0:06:57.89,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,They don't demand strength from female jujutsu sorcerers.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.16,0:07:46.24,Default,Kamo,0,0,0,,It imbues cursed energy into sound,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.24,0:07:50.11,Default,Kamo,0,0,0,,so you just have to protect your brain and your ears with cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.48,0:07:54.11,Default,Kamo,0,0,0,,Cursed speech is a technique specialized for use against cursed spirits.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.11,0:07:59.75,Default,Kamo,0,0,0,,Like I said before, it's nothing for a sorcerer to be afraid of if you know it's coming.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.15,0:08:05.25,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,{\i1}Conversely, if you don't know whether or not it's coming, you're constantly distracted.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.97,0:08:09.68,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,{\i1}I'm not used to protecting the inside of my head in the first place...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.06,0:08:12.97,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,{\i1}He's such a nuisance whether he's here or not!

Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.14,0:09:05.27,Default,,0,0,0,,just to obtain what we enjoy as a matter of course?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.22,0:09:10.82,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Why don't you try thinking that over with that brain of yours
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.70,0:09:13.48,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,that confuses curses for friends?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.71,0:09:17.43,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,Shut up.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.43,0:09:20.52,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,You think misfortune is a free pass to do anything?

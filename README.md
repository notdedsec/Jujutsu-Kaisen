# [Kaizoku] Jujutsu Kaisen

## Scripts used for Kaizoku's release of [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://anidb.net/anime/15275)

The subtitles are based on Crunchyroll's translation, with a fair bit of editing and translation checking, timing fixes, song translations and ~~lazy~~ creative typesetting with ~~stolen~~ borrowed masks. An alternate honorifics track is included too. They're muxed with a descaled, scene-filtered encode, the base scripts for which can be found [here](https://github.com/notdedsec/Jujutsu-Kaisen/blob/master/common).

This project utilizes [SubKt](https://github.com/Myaamori/subkt/) for handling all the post-processing work, like merging songs, dialogue and typesetting scripts, generating chapters, release muxing and creating torrents, among other things.

It uses another little [script](https://github.com/notdedsec/Jujutsu-Kaisen/blob/main/preprocess.py) I made for saving me a few clicks each week by pre-processing the base files and setting up the work folder and scripts for every episode. It's not intended to be a general purpose script but I've tried to document it so modifying it for other projects shouldn't be too difficult.

You can find this release and all our [other releases](https://github.com/notdedsec/Fansubbing) on Nyaa and AnimeKaizoku.

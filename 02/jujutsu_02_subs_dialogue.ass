Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.09,0:04:24.79,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,Suspended?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.20,0:04:27.00,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,So you're not killing me right away?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.36,0:04:28.38,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,Yup.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.38,0:04:29.89,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,I'll explain from the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.62,0:04:33.66,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,This is the same as the cursed object you ate.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.72,0:04:43.97,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,No, Sukuna has four arms.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.04,0:04:53.40,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,As you can see, we can't destroy them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.40,0:04:55.45,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,The curse is just that powerful.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.75,0:04:58.18,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,The curse grows stronger by the day,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.18,0:05:01.44,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,and the seals of modern-day jujutsu sorcerers can't keep up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.44,0:05:02.91,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,That's where you come in.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.97,0:05:06.95,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,When you die, the curse inside you will die, as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.22,0:05:10.75,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,Our elders are cowards, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.75,0:05:13.20,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,They're demanding we kill you right away.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.32,0:05:16.66,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,But that would be a waste, wouldn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.66,0:05:18.03,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,A waste?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.03,0:05:22.55,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,There's no guarantee another vessel capable of handling Sukuna will ever be born again.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.87,0:05:24.93,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,So this is what I proposed:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.05,0:05:27.86,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,If we're going to kill you anyway,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.86,0:05:30.88,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,why not kill you after you've absorbed all of Sukuna?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.01,0:05:33.76,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,The higher-ups agreed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.76,0:05:36.87,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,So now you have two options before you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.31,0:05:38.97,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,You can die right now,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.40,0:05:41.84,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,or you can find all the parts of Sukuna
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.84,0:05:44.07,Default,Gojou,0,0,0,,and die after you've absorbed them.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.71,0:07:59.05,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,I believe you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.38,0:08:02.00,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,Those weren't monsters. They were curses.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.47,0:08:08.31,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,That finger was a special-grade cursed object.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.31,0:08:11.48,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,It had the power to draw other curses to it and make them stronger.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.12,0:08:14.47,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,So it wasn't your fault.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.46,0:08:17.74,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,It was mine for picking it up.

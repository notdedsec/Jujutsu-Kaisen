Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.22,0:00:27.47,Default,Haruta,0,0,0,,you worked too hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.88,0:00:38.77,Default,Haruta,0,0,0,,Poor thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.50,0:01:02.96,Default,Haruta,0,0,0,,But I guess a curse wouldn't understand such subtleties.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.01,0:01:12.84,Default,Haruta,0,0,0,,So, got the goods?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.98,0:01:15.77,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Without a hitch.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.70,0:01:20.63,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,All six of the special-grade "Sukuna's Finger" cursed objects
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.15,0:01:23.22,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,that Jujutsu High possessed...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.16,0:01:26.21,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,and the other special-grade cursed object,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.21,0:01:30.74,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,"Cursed Wombs: Death Paintings," One through Three.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.77,0:01:34.24,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Most of the temples at Jujutsu High
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.24,0:01:36.48,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,are actually just a facade.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.60,0:02:03.48,Default,,0,0,0,,so I doubt anyone will interfere.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.62,0:02:14.10,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He has immortality, but not eternal youth.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.50,0:02:16.99,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,You can think of him as just a tree.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.69,0:02:19.94,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Tengen basically doesn't interfere with the world,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.94,0:02:22.04,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,aside from maintaining barriers.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.04,0:02:23.75,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,You really don't have to worry about him.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.91,0:02:28.00,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Remember the finger we let Jujutsu High retrieve previously?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.75,0:02:33.60,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I placed a charm comprised of Mahito's cursed energy on it before they collected it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.60,0:02:37.52,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,It's under a single-layer seal, so they won't remove it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.08,0:02:40.20,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He'll be able to find it easily.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.20,0:02:41.93,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Any gatekeepers?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.93,0:02:45.71,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,There are two of Tengen's attendants between the door and the storeroom,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.71,0:02:46.84,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,but they're chumps.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.38,0:02:50.56,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,More importantly, before the veil goes down,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.56,0:02:55.06,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I'd like you to thin out the sorcerers standing by at Jujutsu High as quietly as possible.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.03,0:03:02.04,Default,Hanami,0,0,0,,Why aren't we sealing Gojo Satoru within the veil?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.01,0:03:07.04,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Because we don't want him to direct his attention toward Mahito's main mission.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.51,0:03:13.02,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,And we need him to exercise a degree of his full power,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.02,0:03:15.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,or it won't be a proper test of the veil.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.33,0:03:17.83,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Trapping the students inside will be more effective.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.83,0:03:21.24,Default,Hanami,0,0,0,,Is it okay to kill all but Sukuna's vessel?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.24,0:03:23.90,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,That's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.59,0:03:28.75,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Sukuna's actions
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.75,0:03:31.32,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,aren't quite what I had imagined.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.03,0:03:34.57,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,This is just my guess,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.92,0:03:38.08,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,but I believe one of the students
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.08,0:03:40.43,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,acts as a land mine for Sukuna.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.17,0:03:43.89,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,If we step on that,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.89,0:03:47.46,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,then in the worst case, all of our current plans will be ruined.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.46,0:03:50.86,Default,Jogo,0,0,0,,We should just kidnap Itadori ahead of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.86,0:03:52.48,Default,Jogo,0,0,0,,He's a pawn we'll be using anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.48,0:03:54.39,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,No, Itadori...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.39,0:03:56.99,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,or rather, Sukuna himself, is also a bomb.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.99,0:04:00.22,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Both for us and for Jujutsu High.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.04,0:04:09.18,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,We shouldn't agitate it until the moment we want more chaos:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.02,0:04:14.48,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,October 31st, in Shibuya.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.53,0:04:20.88,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,We should keep everything we can use to seal Gojo Satoru in reserve until then.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.75,0:04:28.13,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,We'll have a few curse users accompany us, too,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.59,0:04:30.13,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,but Kumiya Juzo...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.13,0:04:31.60,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He's disposable.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.60,0:04:34.78,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He's not the kind of person who can follow a plan all the way through.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.78,0:04:36.38,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He'll get in our way later.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.09,0:04:41.74,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,We'll have a different human monitoring our commissioned test run of the veil,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.74,0:04:43.41,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,so get along with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.41,0:04:46.13,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Hear that? Get along, Jogo!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.13,0:04:46.97,Default,Jogo,0,0,0,,Hmph!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.97,0:04:48.81,Default,Jogo,0,0,0,,I'm not going, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.97,0:04:55.09,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Come on, wake up, Hanami.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.58,0:04:56.77,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Let's go home.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.53,0:04:58.74,Default,Hanami,0,0,0,,Mahito.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.84,0:05:04.95,Default,Hanami,0,0,0,,Trying to pump the brakes on my hostility is incredibly stressful.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.49,0:05:12.03,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,You're sounding more like a curse, too, Hanami.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.16,0:06:56.34,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,They're all sorcerers who were standing by at Jujutsu High
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.34,0:07:00.23,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,and working separately from Gojo{**-san} and Principal Yaga.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.68,0:07:03.06,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,We're waiting on the report from Ieiri{**-san},
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.06,0:07:06.12,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,but we're nearly certain it was the work of the cursed spirit
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.12,0:07:07.82,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,that Nanami{**-san} encountered before.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.82,0:07:08.74,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Tsk.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.74,0:07:13.87,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,Do you think we should share this information with the students and the other sorcerers?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.03,0:07:16.18,Default,Gakuganji,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.18,0:07:18.91,Default,Yaga,0,0,0,,It's probably better to keep this among the higher-ups.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.91,0:07:23.33,Default,Yaga,0,0,0,,We don't want to give curse users certainty that special-grade objects were stolen.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.33,0:07:25.63,Default,Yaga,0,0,0,,Has the curse user we captured spilled anything?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.72,0:07:29.44,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,It's not hard to get him to talk,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.44,0:07:33.42,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,but most of what he says is irrelevant nonsense.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.42,0:07:36.54,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,However, he claims that he only participated in the attack
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.54,0:07:41.28,Default,,0,0,0,,because he was ordered to as part of a deal.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.21,0:07:45.30,Default,Juzo,0,0,0,,I wanted to make a coat rack.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.30,0:07:47.28,Default,Juzo,0,0,0,,That monk promised me that.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.53,0:07:53.91,Default,Juzo,0,0,0,,Just a brat with white hair in a bob cut.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.37,0:07:59.54,Default,MeiMei,0,0,0,,An androgynous monk kid with a bob cut?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.54,0:08:01.12,Default,MeiMei,0,0,0,,That ring any bells?

Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.54,0:08:09.27,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,How did a cursed spirit and outsiders
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.27,0:08:11.76,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,get through Tengen{**-sama}'s barriers in the first place?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.76,0:08:16.19,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,That was probably the work of the special-grade cursed spirit the students fought.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.96,0:08:18.82,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,That one has a unique presence.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.52,0:08:23.31,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Even though it's a cursed spirit, it's incredibly close to a natural spirit.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.31,0:08:27.31,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,According to Aoi, it was able to hide among plants.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.84,0:08:31.58,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,And Tengen{**-sama}'s barrier doesn't function against plants.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.00,0:08:36.50,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Tengen{**-sama}'s barrier puts all its power into hiding, not protecting.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.50,0:08:39.39,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,So once you get in, it's kind of weak.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.96,0:08:47.82,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}Are they worried about Sukuna's Fingers enhancing Yuji's potential?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.82,0:08:50.82,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}Or are they trying to enhance themselves?

Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.25,0:08:58.56,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,For now, let's be glad our students are safe.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.44,0:09:03.84,Default,Yaga,0,0,0,,But it goes without saying that the exchange event is now canceled.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.84,0:09:05.11,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.11,0:09:07.57,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,That's not for us to decide, is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.64,0:09:14.46,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,When did you start getting along with that gorilla?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.41,0:09:29.50,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,You believe I could've been drinking liquor in that situation?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.50,0:09:31.46,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,I'm shocked.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.79,0:09:36.08,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,But I'm glad you weren't seriously hurt, Fushiguro.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.08,0:09:37.96,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,You're able to eat pizza now, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.53,0:09:45.98,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,No complaining.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.87,0:09:50.89,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Apparently, I got off easier because my cursed energy was all dried up.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.33,0:09:55.23,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Ieiri{**-san} was still able to fix me up as soon as the roots were removed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.23,0:09:57.48,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Huh, so that's a thing that can happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.48,0:10:00.18,Default,Kugisaki,0,0,0,,You fought against them, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.15,0:10:02.00,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Itadori.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.45,0:10:05.97,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,You've grown stronger.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.30,0:10:13.60,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Back then, we both said our convictions were proper ones.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.37,0:10:18.37,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,I still think that's true.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.37,0:10:22.22,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Or, put another way, we're both wrong.

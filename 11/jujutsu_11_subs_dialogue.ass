Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.72,0:05:40.91,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,But it's just a splatter film,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.91,0:05:44.90,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,so maybe it's our own fault for asking it to deliver more than that.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.49,0:06:07.27,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,but it actually captures
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.27,0:06:11.19,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,the changing emotions of the perfectionist who abandons everything.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.43,0:06:24.25,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,so I made myself watch it three times.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.25,0:06:27.76,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,It had the most effective gory scenes, too, so it wasn't easy to rewatch.

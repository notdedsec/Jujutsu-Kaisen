Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.43,0:04:34.38,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,I wonder if the first person to say "the opposite of fondness is indifference"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.99,0:04:37.52,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,went to hell like they should have.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.98,0:04:41.88,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,It's just not possible that interacting maliciously with others
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.26,0:04:45.98,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,could be more proper than leaving them alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.29,0:04:49.57,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,"The opposite of fondness is hate."
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.25,0:04:52.29,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,Japanese people love that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.84,0:04:56.52,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,They like to gloat over complicating a simple answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.58,0:05:00.11,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,The man who coined that phrase wasn't Japanese.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.71,0:05:04.42,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,I'm talking about the mistaken translation.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.84,0:05:09.80,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,The original phrase, spoken by some foreigner,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.27,0:05:13.52,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,was "the opposite of love is indifference," right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.89,0:05:20.99,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,There are various definitions of "love," so "indifference" works as an antonym there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.39,0:05:22.79,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,That's true.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.62,0:05:27.11,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,But we generally don't use "love" very much, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.67,0:05:29.41,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,That's why, in this country,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.68,0:05:32.61,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,it got changed to "fondness" at some point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.91,0:05:37.10,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,That version spread without any thought as to whether the opposing definitions
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.66,0:05:40.44,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,of "love" and "indifference" still held true.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.50,0:05:44.24,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Everyone likes a little wordplay.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.72,0:05:49.50,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,After all, humans can't live without making up excuses.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.01,0:05:56.21,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,What's this?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.40,0:06:02.09,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,An experiment to see just how large I can make a single human.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.89,0:06:09.13,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,On that one, I tried to see how small I could make one.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.56,0:06:11.78,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,This is...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.38,0:06:14.58,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,a human?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.18,0:06:28.68,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,and end up hating you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.78,0:06:33.58,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,But I already know how repulsive humans can be.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.83,0:06:38.48,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,That's why I don't expect anything from other people,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.25,0:06:42.96,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,nor do I think much of it when someone I don't know dies.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.16,0:06:48.82,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,Indifference is the virtue people ought to strive for.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.07,0:06:54.48,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,And despite that, you want revenge.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.42,0:06:58.65,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,Are you trying to say that's contradictory?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.96,0:07:03.52,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Do you believe people have hearts?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.02,0:07:06.73,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,Huh? Do they not?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.52,0:07:08.41,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,They don't.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.06,0:07:11.73,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,They have souls,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.73,0:07:13.80,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,but souls aren't hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.80,0:07:15.90,Default,Junpei,0,0,0,,Then what about my—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.91,0:07:21.16,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,I'm the only person in this world who understands the composition of souls.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.67,0:07:26.89,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,After all, I change the shape of other creatures by making contact with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.50,0:07:31.78,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,All emotions are the result of the soul's metabolism.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.41,0:07:35.31,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,They're far too mechanical to call hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.32,0:07:40.24,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,People place too much value on things they can't see.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.79,0:07:42.38,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,I can see them,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.38,0:07:46.29,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,and souls are no more special than physical bodies.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.72,0:07:50.75,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,They're just there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.36,0:07:52.46,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Do you get it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.46,0:07:55.06,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,There's no value or importance to life.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.65,0:07:57.97,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Life just continues its cycle,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.36,0:08:00.75,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,same as the waters of the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.94,0:08:04.16,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,That's true for both you and me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.48,0:08:07.20,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Our lives are meaningless and have no value.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.96,0:08:22.40,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,There's no need for consistency in how you live your life.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.22,0:08:27.09,Default,Mahito,0,0,0,,Just as you eat when you get hungry, you can kill someone if you hate them.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.14,0:09:00.59,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,It looks like he hasn't attended school for some time.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.37,0:09:04.92,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,The same could be said for me, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.41,0:09:07.18,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,So are the others doing well?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.51,0:09:22.50,Default,Yuuji,0,0,0,,Huh? Is that a cursed spirit?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.73,0:09:25.04,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,It's a fly head,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.04,0:09:27.70,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,a low-level curse that doesn't even qualify as grade 4.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.31,0:09:33.18,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,Once we reach a place with no people, we'll have it attack him.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.24,0:10:32.45,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,Typically, cursed spirits are assigned to sorcerers of equal grade.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.74,0:10:38.55,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,That means a grade 2 sorcerer would be \Nexpected to beat grade 2 cursed spirits.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.55,0:10:42.52,Default,Ijichi,0,0,0,,So a grade 2 sorcerer possesses strength \Nclose to a grade 1 cursed spirit.
